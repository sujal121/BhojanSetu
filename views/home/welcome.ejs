			<p>Food waste is a bigger problem than many people realize.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					In fact, nearly one-third of all food produced in the world is discarded or wasted for various reasons. That equates to nearly 1.3 billion tons every year.
				</li>
				<li>
					So instead of wasting the food, it should be better donated to the needy because nearly about thousands of needy people sleep without food due to a lack of money or availability.
				</li>
				<li>
					So don't waste food; it's like wasting one of the most precious things given by God to us.
				</li>
				<li>
					We aim at collecting excessive food from hotels, family/public functions, pack them neatly, and provide them to the needy homeless people around us.
				</li>
				<li>
					No food waste is a mission to end food waste and hunger to make the "World Hunger Free."
